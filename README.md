# sdl2-cimgui-template

Template to start a SDL2/OpenGL project with cimgui for windows.

I made this as simple as possible to use but the reality is if you want more control over the build process you will need to use cmake or create a makefile. If you want to statically link cimgui you should use cmake and I may add one in the future.

Instructions
  - Clone the repository.
  - Run the batch file.

Libraries
  - SDL2 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
  - glad https://glad.dav1d.de/
  - cimgui https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui
