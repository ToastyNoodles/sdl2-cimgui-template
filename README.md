# sdl2-cimgui-template

Template to start a SDL2/OpenGL project with cimgui for windows.

I made this as simple as possible to use but the reality is if you want more control over the build process you will need to use cmake or create a makefile.

Instructions
  - Clone the repository.
  - Run the batch file.
  
Libraries
  - SDL2 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
  - glad https://glad.dav1d.de/
  - cimgui https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui
